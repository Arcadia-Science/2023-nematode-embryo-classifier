# This module contains interactive tests, which should eventually be turned into integration tests using fixtures.

# Run these tests with pytest -s -v --disable_warings <test_name.py>

# test_annotations.py
# # This CLI parses the annotations of developmental stages and writes them with the corresponding zarr stores.
# # Doing so tests that annotations and data match, and are correctly parsed.
